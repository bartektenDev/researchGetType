# researchGetType


**What is it?** This is a project that was only intended for personal research use. Do what you please, it was mean't to help identify
how getType works in electron and help create the documentation for getType in Electron!

**Status**: 
- [x] Identify when window loads
- [x] Inject custom string from main.js into index.html
- [ ] Identify how getType works. (It's buggy and not working like it should. Seems like code in C++ of electron is missing)
